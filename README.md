A banner with a timed sliding animation that invites the user to join a Facebook group depending on location. Developed for https://yourpropertyabroad.com.

## The problem

Figuring out how to extract the location from the URL, remove accents and hyphens, and capitalize the correct letters was a really fun little JavaScript puzzle for me to solve. It was also my first time working with Vue, and I found the framework very intuitive and straight-forward. Although I can see how components can easily grow to quite a hefty size, I found the structure and syntax of Vue to be highly approachable.
